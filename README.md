## ðŸ§  Behind the Scenes

This calculator is powered by simple yet effective JavaScript logic:

- Symbols like `Ã—` and `Ã·` are user-friendly, but under the hood theyâ€™re replaced with `*` and `/` before evaluation.
- Keyboard events are captured to make the calculator intuitive to use.
- The design adjusts for dark mode using CSS classes toggled via JavaScript.
